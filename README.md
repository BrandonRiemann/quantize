# quantize
 Color quantization using the K-means algorithm

## What is it?
Color quantization is the process of reducing the color palette of an image to a fixed number of colors. The K-means algorithm is one particular method among others to achieve this result. This has a number of other applications in image processing such as image segmentation and feature detection. This was an early project of mine for a programming course, written primarily in Python with C libraries for speed.

## Running
I have tested the code with Python 3.7 on Windows. Simply run the command: python quantize.py
